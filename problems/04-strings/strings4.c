// Sequence homology is the biological homology between DNA, RNA, or protein sequences, defined in terms of shared ancestry in the evolutionary history of life.
// Two segments of DNA can have shared ancestry because of three phenomena: orthologs, paralogs, or lateral or xenologs.
// You are provided with two random sequence of base 25 DNA, find out if they shared ancestery.
// For hints type "hint"
